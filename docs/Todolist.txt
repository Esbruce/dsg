Today we have a lot to do before launch. 
Use this list to help give context to the fixes i instruct you to make in the chat.

1 we need to improve the security of the protected routes. By this I mean to make sure that users cannot access a route they

are not supposed to. Are protected routes and components are 

billing page (must be authenticated)
processing doc (must be authenticated)
Invite widget in sidebar (must be authenticated)



4 we need to ensure that the user sessions only last 15 minutes. ie they get signed out after 15 minutes of unactivitiy or maybe we should make that shortet

5 we need to configure a production stripe 

6 we need to ensure there are no syncing issues of the user data


8 We need to upload a favicon and rename the site name to Discharge Summary Generator


10 We need to test the security of the app and database

11 I noticed that the app was not loading user status correcly when i was not on incognito tab. We need to investigate this and fix it.

Any other things you recognise when asked you should site and tell mean

These points arent in a particular order.
